# Capstone-CI-Scrapbook
For our project “Scrapbook”  it is a digital journal that is location-based which lets users share any experiences that may be personal to them and store it to locations on a map. Within “Scrapbook” it allows users to pinpoint any locations they have visited recently or been to in the past and attach a photo along with a journal entry about their experience. Users can allow their post to be public to everyone or  be private and only shared with who they choose. 

Deliverables
